# <Choose-Your-Pokemon>

## Description

This site will use two Web APIs to display GIFs of Pokemon that was searched and then store favorited Pokemon in local storage. This site will help people explore the world of the first 151 Pokemon as well as GIFs they will enjoy related to the Pokemon of their choice. What we learned the most is how to interact with different web APIs to achieve results.

## Installation

No Installation is required for this site.

## Usage

Use the search bar to find and "catch" the first 151 pokemon. Wise with who you choose to be on your team because you are only allowed to keep 6 of your favorites! Are you a little nervous about selecting your pokemon? No worries! There are 6 random pokemon displayed on the screen to choose from that will help you find GIFs of many pokemon that you like!

I GIF YOU!
